    "Unique Adaptations: Polar bears have several physical and behavioral adaptations that enable them to survive in their Arctic habitat. Their thick fur coat, which can reach up to 2 inches (5 cm) in length, helps to keep them warm in temperatures as low as -34°F (-36°C). Their white coloration acts as camouflage in the snow and ice, while their broad paws act as snowshoes, allowing them to move easily across the snow and ice. \n",
